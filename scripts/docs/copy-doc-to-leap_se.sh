# This script is intended to copy a single HTML documentation page generated
# using sphinx to the leap.se amber repository that builds the website.
#
# Because amber works differently than sphinx, the following modifications are
# made in the sphinx automatically generated single html page:
#
#   - Remove everything from the start up to "<body>". Amber will take care of
#     adding the HTML template to the top of the file.
#
#   - Remove everything from "</body>" up to "</html>". Amber will take care of
#     adding the HTML template to the end of the file.
#
#   - Remove the navigation div. Amber will take care of adding it's own TOC.
#
#   - Remove the main <h1> tag. Amber adds it automatically.
#
#   - Remove all unicode paragraph characters. They are not hidden by amber and
#     would make the page ugly.
#
#   - Move h2, h3, h4 to one level up (i.e. h1, h2, h3), because amber expects
#     this kind of page organization in order to render TOC and navigation
#     correctly.
#
#   - Turn h5-h7 to simple emphasized paragraphs, otherwise they would be
#     rendered in a huge TOC.
#
#   - Remove the indices and tables from the end of the file, as amber does it
#     by itself.
