    A multipart writer adapted from python-couchdb's one so we can PUT
    documents using couch's multipart PUT.

    This stripped down version does not allow for nested structures, and
    contains only the essential things we need to PUT SoledadDocuments to the
    couch backend. Also, please note that this is a patch. The couchdb lib has
    another implementation that works fine with CouchDB 1.6, but removing this
    now will break compatibility with bigcouch.
