    SQLCipher makes direct use of libssl, so all cipher options available
    to libssl are also available for use with SQLCipher. See `man enc` for
    OpenSSL's supported ciphers.

    used to adjust the page size for the encrypted database. The default
    page size is 1024 bytes, but it can be desirable for some applications
    to use a larger page size for increased performance. For instance,
    some recent testing shows that increasing the page size can noticeably
    improve performance (5-30%) for certain queries that manipulate a
    large number of pages (e.g. selects without an index, large inserts in
    a transaction, big deletes).

    To adjust the page size, call the pragma immediately after setting the
