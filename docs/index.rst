Soledad documentation
=====================

Soledad is an acronym for Synchronization of Locally Encrypted Data Among
Devices. It is LEAP's solution for synchronizing client-encrypted data among
all user's devices that access a LEAP provider.

The application is written in Python and the `source code
<https://0xacab.org/leap/soledad>`_ is available and licensed as free software.
Both client and server are `distributed through pypi
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/leap.soledad>`_, and `Debian packages
<https://deb.leap.se/>`_ are also provided for the server-side component.
